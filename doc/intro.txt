== Overview ==

The Sapphire Telemetry System is a telemetry downlink system for the Sapphire test rocket by Copenhagen Suborbitals. Its purpose is to support downlink of high rate telemetry from the GNC and AAU units allowiung detailed analysis of the complete test flight.

The telemetry system is based on a design origninally created for the Romit 2 cubesat built by Euroluna and has the following characteristics:

- Two downlink channels working simultaneously
- Works in the 2.4 GHz band (exact frequencies TBC)
- 1 watt RF output per channel
- Up to 2 Mbps bitrate per channel (including all headers, FEC, etc.)
- FSK modulation (GFSK?)
- Rate 1/2 FEC

The telemetry system consists of the following components:

Transmitter::  The transmitter is based on the ADF7242 transceiver chip running in raw mode. The digital data interface to the payload goes through a PIC24, which is responsible for converting the potentially variable rate data to fixed rate. The transmitter is described in details in section TBD.

Receiver:: The receiver is a software defined radio using USRP hardware and GNU Radio based software receiver. It runs on a Linux PC and delivers the telemetry data via Ethernet or RS232 interface. The receiver is set up to run autonomously and does not require any user intervention; however, key parameters are exported via a controlport interface. This allows remote clients to conenct to the receiver, monitor the system performance, and modify some key parameters that may be necessary during the mission. The receiver is described in details in section TBD.

M&C panel:: The monitoring and control panel is a client that connects to the receiver and displays system performance (spectrum, SNR, data and error rates, etc.) to mission control crew. It also allows modifying some basic settings in the receiver chain such as frequencies, active channels, recording on/off, etc. The M&C panel is descrtibed in more details together with the receiver itself in section TBD.

Tracking tower:: An AZ/EL mount built specifically for tracking fast flying objects. It can carry many antennas of different shapes and sizes as long as the construction stays balanced. For the Sapphire mission it carries two 2.4 GHz yagi antennas, one vertically and horizontally polarized. Each antenna is connected to a receiver that receives both downlink channels; however, only one channel of the horizontal receiver is monitored in real time. The other channels are recorded for reference.
